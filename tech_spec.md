## Project Overview

Build a streamlined interface for managing AI model fine-tuning jobs with a focus on creating new jobs and viewing existing ones.

IMPORTANT
We value your time and have designed this exercise to take no more than 3 - 4 hours. Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add polish if time permits.

## Technical Requirements

### Required technologies (must use)

- Next.js: Implement the application using Next.js framework
- TypeScript: Ensure type safety with proper TypeScript implementation

### Features to Demonstrate (priority order)

#### Fine-Tuning Job Creation Form:

- Create a form for setting up new fine-tuning jobs
- Include fields for:
  - Job name (with validation for 3-50 chars, alphanumeric and dashes)
  - Base model selection (from available options)
  - Number of training epochs
  - Evaluation epochs (with validation against total epochs)
  - Warm-up epochs (with validation against total epochs)
  - Learning rate (between 0 and 1)
  - Implement state management for the form process

#### API Integration:

- Connect to the fine-tuning API endpoints:
  - GET /api/jobs - List all jobs with summary statistics
  - POST /api/jobs - Create a new job
  - GET /api/models - List available models for selection in form
- Optional:
  - DELETE functionality for jobs

#### Job Listing Dashboard:

- Display a list of all fine-tuning jobs
- Show key job details including status (Running, Completed, Failed)
- Display summary statistics (total completed, running, and failed jobs)
- Optional: Implement job deletion functionality

#### Our tech stack (optional)

- shadcn
- react query
- tailwind

#### API Information

- Base URL: https://fe-test-api-production-cb39.up.railway.app/
- API Documentation: https://fe-test-api-production-cb39.up.railway.app/api/openapi.json
- Authentication: Use the provided x-api-key for all requests
- Tip: You can view and explore the OpenAPI schema in a more user-friendly format by pasting the schema JSON into https://editor-next.swagger.io/

#### Key Skills to Demonstrate

- State Management: For form with interdependent field validations
- API Integration: Proper handling of asynchronous operations
- Form Validation: Ensuring data integrity according to the API requirements
- Response Handling: Managing loading, error, and success states
- Component Design: Creating reusable and maintainable UI components
- Styling: Implementing a clean, professional interface
